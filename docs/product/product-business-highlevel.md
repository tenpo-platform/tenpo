# Tenpo Product & Business Overview

**What it is:** A marketplace for sports camps — think Airbnb but for kids' sports camps.

---

## The Two Sides

**Camp Organizers**
- Sports camps (soccer, basketball, etc.) who want to reach more families
- They create camp listings with details, pricing, dates
- They need to see who registered, track sales, export participant lists, send updates to parents

**Parents/Athletes**
- Families looking for sports camps for their kids
- They browse camps, compare options, register and pay
- They need to track their bookings, save child info (emergency contacts, medical info) for faster checkout next time

## The Business Model

### Phase 1: B2B2C (First 6-8 months)

We partner with **academies** — organizations that run camps and clinics and have coaches on their roster.

What we do for them:
- Easy registration system
- Payment processing
- Handle parent communication and data

What we DON'T do: Marketing on their behalf. We're infrastructure, not a marketing agency.

**Revenue:** We charge a small markup to parents. They pay for the camp through us, we take a cut as the middleman.

**Goal:** Get to hockey stick growth while harvesting data. Every parent who signs up = user. Every academy = user. Every coach who builds a profile = future asset.

---

## The Strategic Play

Here's the long game:

Academies are the entry point, but **coaches are the real target.**

In our agreement with academies, we require that their coaches build individual profiles on Tenpo. Academies get our platform, we get coach data. Fair trade.

### Phase 2: B2B2C + B2C2C

Once we hit critical mass of coaches:
- Camps/clinics and **individual coaches** become equally important on the platform
- Parents can book a camp (through an academy) OR book a coach directly
- Coaches can operate independently — they don't need to be tied to an academy
- We introduce a matching algorithm: **Airbnb meets Tinder** for finding the right coach

The academies don't get cut out — they become one option among many. Coaches gain independence. Parents get more choice.

## Beachhead: Bay Area Soccer

**Why here:**
- Cofounder lives in the Bay Area
- She already runs her own academy — built-in credibility and network
- Soccer is the entry sport

---

## Expansion Strategy

| Direction | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Horizontal** | More academies, more geographic regions, more sports (basketball, baseball, etc.) |
| **Vertical** | More features for academies and parents/athletes (deeper product, not just wider) |

All of this stays B2B2C until the coach flywheel kicks in.

## Mobile App (~Month 5)

**Platforms:** iOS native + PWA for Android

| User | What the app does for them |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Parents** | Push notifications, booking info (replaces email), manage multiple kids in one place |
| **Coaches** | See new bookings, confirm them, message parents directly |
| **Academies** | Same as coaches — booking management and communication |

**Web = master.** Everything can be done on the web — discovery, bookings, management, communication, the works.

**Mobile = convenience.** The app surfaces critical features for each user type — notifications, quick confirmations, messaging. It's for people already in the system who need fast access on the go.

---

## What Each User Needs

| User | Core Needs |
|------|-----------|
| **Parents** | Find camps easily, book/pay quickly, see upcoming registrations, store child profiles |
| **Academies** | Easy registration, payment processing, parent management, coach roster tools |
| **Coaches** | Build profile, eventually operate independently, get discovered |

## Key Product Decisions

1. **Parents create accounts at checkout** — not before. Let them browse freely, only ask for account when they're buying.

2. **Everything on one domain** (jointenpo.com) — no separate marketing site. Better for SEO and keeps design consistent.

3. **Start simple, add tools when needed** — build fast, add complexity only when the pain of not having it outweighs the setup cost.

## The Philosophy

> "Build everything yourself and pay no one."

Keep it simple, own everything, avoid vendor dependencies.
